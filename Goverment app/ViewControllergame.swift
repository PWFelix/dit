import UIKit

// A game where the user is presented with a random item of rubbish and must select
// the correct bin to put it in.

// An "enum" lets us use meaningful names in the program, instead of magic numbers.
// See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)#Unnamed_numerical_constants
// and: https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Enumerations.html
// We declare it with type Int, because we will match it with the Int tag of
// a bin button in the UI.
// By default, for Int enums, numbering starts at 0. So:
// green = 0, yellow = 1, red = 2
enum BinColor: Int {
    case green, yellow, red
}

// A "struct" lets us create an logical object in our code that represents an
// entity in the business domain that is the concern of the program.
// Using a struct allows us to express the program's logic in language describing the domain.
// See: https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/ClassesAndStructures.html
// Our program's business domain is "rubbish", so we create the concept of
// a RubbishItem.

    // Their value will be available, and the same, everywhere in this view.

    var currentRubbishItem: RubbishItem!
    // The exclamation mark lets the compiler know that while we don't set a value here,
    // we will set a value for this before we use it.
    // The rubbishItems provide us a collection to choose from randomly. It is an array.
    var rubbishItems: [RubbishItem]!

    // This click handler is linked to all three bins in the UI.
    // All bins call this when they are clicked, and the sender.tag gives away which bin it is,
    // because we set a different tag for each one in the UI designer.

        // .rawValue gives us the Int value of the enum to compare with the tag.
